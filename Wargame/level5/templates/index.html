      <h2>Why Camelotica is the Greatest Place in the Universe</h2>
      <p>Look, Camelotica isn't just a legendary castle on a spaceship, it's a lifestyle. Knights of the Roundtable meet here for frakking joust tournaments. Sir Lancelot is so chivalrous, he even lets Cylons take the first shot.</p>
      <p>We have wizards and advanced AI, Excalibur and laser guns, Holy Grails and FTL drives. Honestly, what else could you possibly need? Also, King Arthur and Admiral Adama are basically besties. So, what say you?</p>
