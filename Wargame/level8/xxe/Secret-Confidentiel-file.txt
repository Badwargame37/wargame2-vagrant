Subject: Battlestar Galactica Credentials - Magic Meets the Stars

Greetings Merlin, Wizard of the Round Table,

We hope this raven-delivered message finds you well amidst the enchanting realms of Camelot! In a most unexpected twist of fate, the good folks over at Battlestar Galactica have deemed you worthy of access to their futuristic, interstellar systems.

With these credentials, you shall now wield the power of technology alongside your magical prowess:
Protocol: SSH 
Username: Merl1n_Th3_W1z4rd
Password: Excal1bur&St4rDust

As you embark on this cosmic journey, please remember the following:

1. Magic spells may not work as expected in zero-gravity environments.

2. While you may be familiar with dragons, you'll encounter Cylons of a different kind - so keep that wizard staff at the ready!

3. "So say we all" is the Battlestar Galactica equivalent of "Abracadabra."

4. In space, the phrase "Once upon a time" takes on a whole new meaning.

Should you need technical support, simply summon "Tech Supportatron 3000" by chanting "Ctrl + Alt + Merlin." They'll be at your service faster than a fire-breathing dragon!

We trust that you will use your newfound access responsibly and refrain from turning any Vipers into newts.

May your journey through the stars be as magical as it is interstellar!

Yours in mirth and stardust,
Admiral Adama & the Crew of Battlestar Galactica
